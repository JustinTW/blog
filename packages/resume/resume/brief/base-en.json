    "brief": "I am a **full-stack web developer and system administrator with 5 years industry and 3 years contract,** specializing in scalable cloud architectures for web application and network maintenance, aiming to become a true software engineer and loves coding a lot. While my work focuses on web engineering, mostly building SPA with front-end framework like Angular, and building RESTful api with back-end framework such as Django or Tornado. For my part-time IT task, I build and maintenance network and various IT service for my company. My non-work interest ranges widely. By spending free time learning other computer science related subjects such as network security and algorithms, my interest into computer just keeps deepening. Building small tools which makes my life easier is also something I love to do on the weekend. I am a Taiwanese and looking for engineer positions in Taiwan.",
